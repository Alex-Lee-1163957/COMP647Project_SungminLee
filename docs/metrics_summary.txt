Assignment-3: Metric Summary
============================

Class imbalance (positive rate): 0.0640

Why these metrics:
- Accuracy is easy to read but can hide minority errors.
- F1 balances precision/recall; good when positives are rare.
- ROC-AUC reflects ranking quality; insensitive to threshold.

Logistic (5-fold CV): acc=0.555±0.002, f1=0.145±0.004, auc=0.594±0.006
DecisionTree (5-fold CV): acc=0.520±0.042, f1=0.142±0.004, auc=0.584±0.010
RandomForest (5-fold CV): acc=0.674±0.019, f1=0.141±0.005, auc=0.588±0.009

Hold-out (Logistic):
acc=0.558, f1=0.136, auc=0.573

How we avoid over/underfitting (per slides):
- Cross‑validation: 5‑fold CV gives a more stable estimate than a single split.
- Feature selection: SelectKBest(chi2, k=30) keeps only salient signals and reduces variance.
- Regularization / constraints:
  * Logistic: default L2 (max_iter with convergence check).
  * DecisionTree: max_depth=8, min_samples_leaf=50 to curb memorization.
  * RandomForest: capped depth (12) and reasonable tree count (200).
- Class imbalance: class_weight='balanced' to avoid over‑predicting the majority.
- Hold‑out sanity check: we report a final CM/ROC on an unseen split.

Notes:
- We purposely keep models compact and comments explicit for grading/interpretability.
- Final choice should balance interpretability (LogReg/Tree) and stability (RF).
